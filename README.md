# Pygame-Dev-Journey

Welcome to my indie game development journey! This repository serves as a collection of all my projects and experiments as I explore game development using Pygame. All code here is open source, and you're free to use it for your own projects.

I'll be uploading the code from my videos, along with any updates or improvements made after the videos are released. Each project will have its own dedicated folder, complete with a `README` file to provide context and instructions.
